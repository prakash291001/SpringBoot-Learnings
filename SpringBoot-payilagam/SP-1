LESSION 1 : BASICS OF SPRINGBOOT
=================================


* in Java, there were some technologies for develope web application like EJB, Struts.

    * core Java - (Java Standard Edition)
    * advance Java - ( Java Enterprise Edition )


    JAR
    ---

    * JAR is Java ARchieve file. which contains lots of java class files. 
    * when you install jdk, behind there are java class file for run simple program. 
    * this is core java.


    WAR
    ---

    * WAR is Web ARchieve file. which contains Java files, HTML files, CSS files, JS files.
    * usually WAR is used when website is developed.

* Spring integrates with all other frameworks like Hibernate, Struts.
    
    spring can connect with hibernate application or struts application. so that spring is popular.


Spring Features :

    * POJO classes (Plain Old Java Objects) - having getters and setters methods.
    * Dependency Injection
    * REST API
    * MVC
    * Security


MVC pattern
-----------

Model View Controller.

    1) view       - view is the UI page. where user sends the request and where user received the response.
    2) controller - controller is the request receiver in backend and send the request to model to process. controller is the one who interacts to both.
    3) model      - model where the business is happen and communicate  to the db and sends back the data to controller.

        * model comprises of service(business logic), repository(db) and entity(data structure).


REST API
--------

API - Application Programming Interface.

* REST isn’t just about URLs and JSON. It’s about designing APIs that are simple, scalable, stateless, and predictable.

6 KEY PRINCIPLES OF REST API
---------------------------

1) Client-Server Architecture

    * the client and server should be seperate. both doesn't need to know each other.

2) Stateless

    * the server doesn't store session information between requests.

3) Cacheable

    * responses from the server should be cached to improve performance. the request doesn't need to hit the db each time.

4) Uniform Interface

    * should use standard http methods. like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

5) Layered System

    * the architecture can have layers. so client talk to API, not to the database.

6) Code On Demand (Optional)

    * the server can send code to the client to extend functionality. like JSP and thymeleaf files to browser to run.

HTTP Methods
------------

GET     - used to get the information.
POST    - used to insert the information into db.
PUT     - used to update the information in db.
DELETE  - used to delete something in db.
PATCH   - used to delete but used partially. if wanted to update specific data or column.



HTTP Status Code
----------------

1xx - Informational

2xx → Success

3xx → Redirection

4xx → Client mistake

5xx → Server mistake



100     - Continue, complete request is not received by server yet.
101     - Switching Protocols, the servers agrees to switch protocols.

200     - SUCCESS , request is succeeded. server processed it successfully. usually used in GET method when data fetched or update/delete worked.
201     - CREATED , resource successfully created. usually used in POST.
202     - ACCEPTED, request is accepted but not yet processed.
204     - NO CONTENT, request is processed but no content to return.

301     - MOVED PERMANENTLY 
302     - FOUND
303     - NOT MODIFIED

400     - BAD REQUEST
401     - UNAUTHORIZED
403     - FORBIDDEN
404     - NOT FOUND
405     - METHOD NOT ALLOWED

500     - INTERNAL SERVER ERROR
501     - NOT IMPLEMENTED
502     - BAD GATEWAY
503     - SERVICE UNAVAILABLE
504     - GATEWAY TIMEOUT
