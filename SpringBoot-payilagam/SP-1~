LESSION 1 : BASICS OF SPRINGBOOT
=================================


* in Java, there were some technologies for develope web application like EJB, Struts.

    * core Java - (Java Standard Edition)
    * advance Java - ( Java Enterprise Edition )


    JAR
    ---

    * JAR is Java ARchieve file. which contains lots of java class files. 
    * when you install jdk, behind there are java class file for run simple program. 
    * this is core java.


    WAR
    ---

    * WAR is Web ARchieve file. which contains Java files, HTML files, CSS files, JS files.
    * usually WAR is used when website is developed.

* Spring integrates with all other frameworks like Hibernate, Struts.
    
    spring can connect with hibernate application or struts application. so that spring is popular.


Spring Features :

    * POJO classes (Plain Old Java Objects) - having getters and setters methods.
    * Dependency Injection
    * REST API
    * MVC
    * Security


MVC pattern
-----------

Model View Controller.

    1) view       - view is the UI page. where user sends the request and where user received the response.
    2) controller - controller is the request receiver in backend and send the request to model to process. controller is the one who interacts to both.
    3) model      - model where the business is happen and communicate  to the db and sends back the data to controller.

        * model comprises of service(business logic), repository(db) and entity(data structure).


REST API
--------

API - Application Programming Interface.

* REST isn’t just about URLs and JSON. It’s about designing APIs that are simple, scalable, stateless, and predictable.

6 KEY PRINCIPLES OF REST API
---------------------------

1) Client-Server Architecture

    * the client and server should be seperate. both doesn't need to know each other.

2) Stateless

    * the server doesn't store session information between requests.

3) Cacheable

    * responses from the server should be cached to improve performance. the request doesn't need to hit the db each time.

4) Uniform Interface

    * should use standard http methods. like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

5) Layered System

    * the architecture can have layers. so client talk to API, not to the database.

6) Code On Demand (Optional)

    * the server can send code to the client to extend functionality. like JSP and thymeleaf files to browser to run.

HTTP Methods
------------

GET     - used to get the information.
POST    - used to insert the information into db.
PUT     - used to update the information in db.
DELETE  - used to delete something in db.
PATCH   - used to delete but used partially. if wanted to update specific data or column.



HTTP Status Code
----------------

1xx - Informational

2xx → Success

3xx → Redirection

4xx → Client mistake

5xx → Server mistake



100     - Continue, complete request is not received by server yet.
101     - Switching Protocols, the servers agrees to switch protocols.

200     - SUCCESS , request is succeeded. server processed it successfully. usually used in GET method when data fetched or update/delete worked.
201     - CREATED , resource successfully created. usually used in POST.
202     - ACCEPTED, request is accepted but not yet processed.
204     - NO CONTENT, request is processed but no content to return.

301     - MOVED PERMANENTLY 
302     - FOUND
303     - NOT MODIFIED

400     - BAD REQUEST
401     - UNAUTHORIZED
403     - FORBIDDEN
404     - NOT FOUND
405     - METHOD NOT ALLOWED

500     - INTERNAL SERVER ERROR
501     - NOT IMPLEMENTED
502     - BAD GATEWAY
503     - SERVICE UNAVAILABLE
504     - GATEWAY TIMEOUT

=======================================================================================================================================================================

LESSION 3 - DEPENDENCY INJECTION AND AUTOWIRING


Important Dependencies for spring applications
----------------------------------------------

Spring Web      -   for web applications
ThymeLeaf       -   for frontend development
Spring JPA      -   for connecting to DB
Actuator        -   for debugging purpose



compilation process
------------------

.java   -> .class file. if we compile .java file, then jvm turn it into .class file which is byte code.

core java   -> JAR file, if we compile core java file, then it packages it to JAR file.

Adv Java (web app)  -> WAR file, it we compile a spring app or any web app, it packages it to WAR file.




Annotations
------------

Spring specific annotations : 

    * spring core annotations :

                        1) @Component
                        2) @Service
                        3) @Repository
                        4) @Controller

    * Dependency Injections specific annotations :

                        1) @AutoWired
                        2) @Qualifier
                        3) @Primary
                        4) @Lazy
                        5) @PostConstruct
                        6) @PreDestroy
                        7) @Value


Springboot specific annotations : 


    * @SpringBootApplication, it include some annotation that are
        
                        1) @SpringBootConfiguration -> in spring, it is @Configurationn
                        2) @EnableAutoConfiguration
                        3) @ComponentScan

    * some conditional annotations

    * REST & WEB annotations

                        1) @Controller
                        2) @RestController
                        3) @RequestMapping
                        4) @GetMapping

                       10) @RequestBody
                       11) @ResponseBody

    * some JPA annotations

                        1) @Repository
                        2) @Table
                        3) @column
                        4) @Entity
                        5) @Id
                        6) @Transactional
                        7) @GeneratedValue


    * Actuator annotations

                        1) @EndPoint
                        2) @ReadOperation
                        3) @WriteOperation
                        4) @DeleteOperation



BEAN SCOPES
-----------

Bean scopes defines how long a bean(object) can live and how many instances spring creates.

SCOPE = life cycle + visibility of a bean


scopes : 
--------

* Singleton (default) - one instance per spring container. same object shared everywhere.

* Prototype           - new instance every time you request the bean.

* request             - one instance per http request.

* session             - one instance per http session.

* application         - one instance per servletcontext.

* websocket           - one instance per websocket session.




Q) what does springapplication.run ?

    it sets up default configuration. starts spring application context automatically. starts/stops tomcat server. it scans class path.


AutoWiring
----------

* used to inject one class object into another class.


Q) diff b/w AutoWired and Qualifier ?

    * autowired search by type. if there are multiple instance are there. so it will look for its type.
    * qualifier search by name. if there are multiple types. it will look into that.



=======================================================================================================================================================================

LESSION 4 - Servlet and JSP.

* there are 2 types of request from browser.

        1) Static request   - it means the data is static for all. like login page, any news website. any tutorials website. because it has static data for all.
        2) Dynamic request  - it means, we request the specific data. search for specific data. we search specific video in youtube.

* when we are hitting dynamic request, it will be reached by web container which resides inside server. which name is web container.
* web container is the one where all servlets resides.


        Q) what is servlet ?

            * simply, servlets is just a java file.
            * this java file runs on server side, might have a name as servlet.



* we are doing multiple dynamic request right, in web container there are multiple servlets right.
* so how do we know which servlets will map to which request and how the response will be delivered.


        Q) how requests are catched and processed ?

            * there is a file named web.xml which has the details of servlet mappings.
            * it has the details of which is request is mapped to which servlet.


* web.xml also called as 'Deployment Descriptor'.

LESSION 5 - SPRING MVC

* Frontend controller is 'Dispatcher Servlet'.
